# **Accident Detection System with Deep Learning**

### **Introduction**
In recent years, there has been a global increase in distracted driving-related traffic incidents, leading to a rise in injuries, property damage, and fatalities. The urgency to address this issue has prompted the development of innovative solutions to track and examine driver behavior, aiming to reduce accident rates. Our project aligns with the Vision Zero initiative, striving to eliminate all traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop an advanced Accident Detection System capable of recognizing accidents in real-time through live video feeds from CCTV cameras mounted on roads. To achieve this, each frame of the video undergoes analysis through a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model specifically trained to distinguish between accident and non-accident related video frames.

Methodology

Proposed Solution 1: CNN-Based Accident Detection
We have implemented a CNN-based approach as our primary solution for detecting distracted drivers. This method leverages deep learning techniques to analyze various postures and circumstances of a distracted driver. The CNN model is trained on a dataset that encompasses diverse scenarios, and the results are thoroughly analyzed to validate its efficiency.

Proposed Solution 2: MobileNetV2 Architecture with Transfer Learning
To enhance the efficiency of our accident detection system, we incorporated MobileNetV2 architecture as our second proposed solution. This architecture is employed for transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained weights to improve the model's ability to distinguish accident-related frames. The utilization of MobileNetV2 aids in achieving a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Proposed Solution 3:  Transfer Learning with SpinalNet Fully Connected Layer
For further refinement, we implemented transfer learning with a SpinalNet fully connected layer. This addition enhances the model's capacity to capture intricate features crucial for accident detection. The SpinalNet layer contributes to the overall robustness of the system and improves its performance in identifying complex accident scenarios.

Data Preprocessing
Our dataset undergoes comprehensive preprocessing, including data augmentation and normalization. These steps are essential to ensure the model's generalization across various scenarios and postures of distracted drivers. Data augmentation helps increase the diversity of the training set, while normalization ensures consistent and standardized input for the neural network.
